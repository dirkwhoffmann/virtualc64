 "The cartridge system implemented in the C64 provides an easy way to 
 hook 8 or 16 kilobytes of ROM into the computer's address space: 
 This allows for applications and games up to 16 K, or BASIC expansions 
 up to 8 K in size and appearing to the CPU along with the built-in 
 BASIC ROM. In theory, such a cartridge need only contain the 
 ROM circuit without any extra support electronics."
