//! The virtual keyboard of a C64
/*! This class manages the keyboard matrix of the virtual C64. 
	Keyboard management works as follows: When the GUI recognizes a pressed or release key,
	it calls one of the functions in this class to tell the virtual keyboard about the event.
	The called functions does nothing more than clearing or setting a bit in the keyboard matrix.
	Communication with the virtual computer is managed solely by the CIA chip. When a special
	CIA register is peeked, method \a getRowValues is called which finally brings the contents
	of the keyboard matrix into the virtual C64.
