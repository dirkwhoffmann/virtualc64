	/*! The  R6522  VIA  has  two  8-bit  bidirectional  I/O ports (Port A and Port B)
		and each port has two associated control lines. 
		
		Each  8-bit  peripheral  port  has  a Data Direction Register (DDRA, DDRB) for
		specifying  whether  the  peripheral pins are to act as inputs or outputs. A 0
		in  a  bit  of the Data Direction Register causes the corresponding peripheral
		pin to act as an input. A 1 causes the pin to act as an output.

		Each  peripheral  pin  is  also controlled  by  a  bit in the Output Register
		(ORA,  ORB)  and  the Input Register (IRA, IRB). When the pin is programmed as
		an  output,  the  voltage on the pin is controlled by the corresponding bit of
		the  Output  Register.  A  1  in  the  Output Register causes the output to go
		high,  and  a  0  causes the output to go low. Data may be written into Output
		Register  bits  corresponding  to pins which are programmed as inputs. In this
		case, however, the output signal is unaffected.

		reaching  zero,  an  interrupt  flag  is  set,  and  IRQ  goes  low  if the T1
		interrupt  is  enabled.  Timer  1  then  disables  any  further  interrupts or
		automatically  transfers  the  contents  of  the  latches into the counter and
		continues  to  decrement.  In  addition, the timer may be programmed to invert
		the  output  signal  on  a peripheral pin (PB7) each time it "times-out". Each

		modes.  This  timer  is comprised of a "write-only" low-order latch (T2L-L), a
		"read-only"  low-order  counter  (T2C-L)  and  a read/write high order counter
		(T2C-H).  The  counter  registers  act as a 16-bit counter which decrements at
