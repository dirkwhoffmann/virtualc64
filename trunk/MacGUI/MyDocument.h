// 1. Intantiate C64Proxy in XIB file
//    No more custom creation of proxy needed
// 2. Use C64Proxy as data source for ObjectController (key value coding)
// 3. C64Proxy will look at received messages (before passing them to the controller) and update internal values accordingly
// 4. Sending "refresh" to C64Proxy object will update all internal values (frequently called when debug pabel is open or on startup)
// 5. Eliminate outlets and custom code for key/value controlled objects
