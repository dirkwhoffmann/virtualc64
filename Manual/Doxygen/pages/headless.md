# Headless App

The purpose of the headless app is to perform a few simple smoke tests at the end of an automated build chain. It creates an emulator instance and utilizes the scripting interface to execute various RetroShell commands. The application is a good starting point to learn how to incorporate the emulator core into your project. It demonstrates how to launch the emulator, send commands to the command queue, and process messages within a registered message receiver.
